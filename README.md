## By [Irina Chelysheva](https://github.com/Chelysheva)([Oxford profile](https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/team/irina-chelysheva)) and [Srinivasa Rao Rao](https://github.com/sraorao)([Oxford profile](https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/team/srinivasa-rao))

This interactive online MSD Skills training course is aimed at MSD postgraduate research students and staff with some programming experience in R who want to expand their skills in order to create reproducible analysis workflows and publication quality figures from biological data. 
 
* 8th Feb @ 9.30am - 1.00pm 
* 15th Feb @ 10.00am - 1.00pm 
* 22th Feb @ 10.00am - 1.00pm 
 
## COURSE AIM 
By the end of this module, you will be able to perform end-to-end analysis of your own data including statistics and advanced visualization using the third-party packages, which extend the functionality of the base R. 

## By the end of this course, you will learn: 
* how to find and install the third-party packages relevant for your analysis 
* how to perform advanced data wrangling 
* how to create your own functions 
* how to create graphs and figures for publication 
* how to visualise more complex data and relationships within the data 


## COURSE FORMAT 
The course is structured into 3 half-day sessions as follows: 
* Session 1 - filtering, grouping, aggregating data - Introduction to common packages such as dplyr and data.table 
* Session 2 – visualising data and statistical information with ggplot2 and its extensions 
* Session 3 – advanced visualization and plots for high-dimensional data (heatmaps, PCA), interactive plots with Shiny/Plotly
